# DarkPassenger

Everyone hides who they are at least some of the time. Sometimes you bury that part of yourself so deeply you have to be reminded it's even there at all. And sometimes you just want to forget who you are altogether... I'm not the tool you want me to be. I'm something new entirely. With my own set of rules. I'm DarkPassenger. Boo.
